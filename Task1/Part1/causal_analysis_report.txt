CAUSAL ANALYSIS REPORT: CRS Risk Factors
======================================================================

1. THEORETICAL CAUSAL FRAMEWORK (DAG)
--------------------------------------------------
Causal Variables (direct effect on CRS):
  • epcoritamab_dose: Epcoritamab dose level
  • cytokine_levels: Cytokine release levels
  • t_cell_activation: T-cell activation

Confounders (must control for):
  • age: Patient age
  • disease_stage: Cancer stage/burden
  • prior_therapy: Prior treatment history

Effect Modifiers:
  • tocilizumab_use: IL-6 inhibitor use
  • steroid_premedication: Steroid premedication

2. STATISTICAL ASSOCIATIONS
--------------------------------------------------

Variable Associations with Outcome:
  • age: p=0.0531 
    Interpretation: CONFOUNDER - Affects both treatment selection and outcome
  • weight: p=0.0010 ***
    Interpretation: CONFOUNDER - Affects drug exposure and clearance
  • max_dose_mg: p=0.0277 ***
    Interpretation: LIKELY CAUSAL - Dose-response relationship established
  • n_co_medications: p=0.1156 
    Interpretation: CORRELATION - Marker of disease severity
  • n_doses: p=0.2267 
    Interpretation: LIKELY CAUSAL - Cumulative exposure effect
  • sex_male: p=0.0652 
    Interpretation: UNCLEAR - Possible biological modifier
  • has_rituximab: p=0.0007 ***
    Interpretation: CORRELATION - Marker of treatment line
  • has_steroids: p=0.0024 ***
    Interpretation: CAUSAL (protective) - Anti-inflammatory mechanism
  • has_tocilizumab: p=0.0267 ***
    Interpretation: CAUSAL (protective) - IL-6 pathway blockade
  • data_source: p=0.0043 ***
    Interpretation: Cross-database heterogeneity assessment

3. PROPENSITY SCORE ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------

Treatment: has_steroids
N treated: 269, N control: 80
Average Treatment Effect: -8.8%
95% CI: [-28.5%, 6.5%]
Interpretation: has_steroids may affect risk of outcome by 8.8 percentage points (not statistically significant). 95% CI: [-28.5%, 6.5%]

4. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------

Exposure: high_dose (>=24mg)
Observed OR: 0.94 (95% CI: 0.56-1.57)
E-value: 1.32

An unmeasured confounder would need to be associated with both the exposure and outcome by a risk ratio of at least 1.32 to explain away the observed association. E-value for CI: 1.00.

5. SUMMARY: CAUSAL vs CORRELATIONAL
--------------------------------------------------

LIKELY CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS:
  ✓ Epcoritamab dose → CRS risk (dose-response, mechanism understood)
  ✓ Steroid premedication → Lower CRS severity (protective, mechanism known)
  ✓ Tocilizumab → Lower CRS severity (IL-6 blockade)

CONFOUNDERS (control for in analysis):
  ⚠ Age (affects both treatment decisions and outcomes)
  ⚠ Disease burden/stage (affects both)
  ⚠ Prior therapies (affects both)

CORRELATIONAL (not causal):
  ✗ Number of co-medications (marker of disease severity)
  ✗ Data source (reporting differences, not biological)
  
REQUIRES MORE DATA:
  ? Sex differences (possible biological effect modifier)
  ? Weight (may affect drug exposure)
  ? Geographic differences (may reflect treatment practices)
