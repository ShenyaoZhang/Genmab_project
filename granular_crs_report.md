## Key Findings with Specific Cutoffs
### 1. Age Stratification
- **Age >65 years CRS patients:** 83.5% death rate (96/115 patients)- **Age ≤65 years CRS patients:** 67.4% death rate (31/46 patients)
**Interpretation:** Age >65 years: 83.5% vs ≤65 years: 67.4% in CRS patients.
### 2. BMI/Obesity Analysis
- **Obese (BMI>30) CRS patients:** 78.4% death rate (29/37 patients)- **Non-obese CRS patients:** 81.8% death rate (121/148 patients)
**Interpretation:** Obese patients (BMI>30) with CRS have a 78.4% death rate.
### 3. Comorbidity Analysis
- **CRS patients with Diabetes:** 78.4% death rate (29/37 patients)- **CRS patients with Hypertension:** 93.5% death rate (29/31 patients)- **CRS patients with Infection:** 84.6% death rate (33/39 patients)- **CRS patients with Cardiac:** 100.0% death rate (3/3 patients)- **CRS patients with Liver:** 100.0% death rate (3/3 patients)- **CRS patients with Cancer:** 81.3% death rate (135/166 patients)
### 4. Drug Combination Analysis
- **CRS patients on Steroid + Antibiotic:** 93.5% death rate (29/31 patients)
### 5. Infection AE + Comorbidity
- **Infection AE + Diabetes CRS patients:** 79.2% death rate (19/24 patients)
**Interpretation:** CRS patients with infection-related adverse events and diabetes have a 79.2% death rate.
