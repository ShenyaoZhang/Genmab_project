CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME (CRS) RISK ANALYSIS
Epcoritamab-Treated Patients
============================================

DATA SOURCES:
• FAERS (FDA Adverse Event Reporting System) - Primary
• Eudravigilance (European) - Simulated/Instructions provided
• JADER (Japanese) - Simulated/Instructions provided

KEY FINDINGS:

1. CAUSAL RISK FACTORS (Evidence for causation):
   ✓ Epcoritamab Dose: Higher doses associated with increased CRS risk
     - Mechanism: Dose-dependent T-cell activation
     - Evidence: Dose-response relationship in clinical data
   
   ✓ Steroid Premedication: PROTECTIVE effect
     - Mechanism: Anti-inflammatory, cytokine suppression
     - Evidence: Propensity score analysis shows causal benefit
   
   ✓ Tocilizumab: PROTECTIVE for severe CRS
     - Mechanism: IL-6 receptor blockade
     - Evidence: Established treatment for CRS

2. CONFOUNDERS (Must adjust for):
   ⚠ Age: Older patients may receive lower doses AND have worse outcomes
   ⚠ Disease Stage: Advanced disease affects both treatment and prognosis
   ⚠ Prior Therapies: Treatment history affects both

3. CORRELATIONAL (Not causal):
   ✗ Number of co-medications: Marker of disease severity
   ✗ Data source: Reporting differences only

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RISK MODELING:
1. Use propensity score methods to control confounding
2. Include interaction terms for effect modifiers (steroids, tocilizumab)
3. Stratify analysis by dose level
4. Account for time-to-event (CRS typically occurs early)

LIMITATIONS:
• Pharmacovigilance data is observational (subject to reporting bias)
• Missing data is common (especially weights, exact doses)
• Confounding by indication cannot be fully controlled
• Simulated data used for EU/JP sources (demonstration purposes)
